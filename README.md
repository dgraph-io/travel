## Experience

Ardan Labs has taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and their material has proven to help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. Ardan Labs knows what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go.

Ardan Labs classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few months to years of experience writing code in Go. The classes provide a very deep knowledge of the programming langauge with a big push on language mechanics, design philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. They cover a lot about “if performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design, decoupling and writing/debugging production software.
